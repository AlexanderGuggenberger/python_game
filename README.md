# python_game
A game coded in python - the player steers a Greek war ship and needs to prevent the conquest of the city of Syrakus by the Roman Empire. This code works on Windows systems only.
Dowload the python_game.zip folder if you want to try it out - it contains the code and all the necessary images and sounds. The code files are uploaded separately as well in case you only want to take a look at them. image_processing.py does the preprocessing of the images, mainly generating frame sequences for the sprites, and it is called from main.py, which contains the actual code for the game.
Click "Spiel starten" to start the game, use the arrow keys to steer the ship and to ram other ships (the text in the game is in German).
